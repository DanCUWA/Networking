# Networking
Networking testing repository.
Basic implementation of different servers in c and python.
Netstat can be used to determine which sockets are open and on what ports.

### PYTHON ###
As they are just standard python files, no building is required contrary to C. 
All files should be run from inside the main Python directory
When inside the main directory, run a file using the following syntax: 
    >> python3 -m {folder}.{file}
For example, to run the basic client: 
    >> python3 -m Client.basic
